# Autogram Botkit

**Warning:** At this point, the framework is very much in an alpha stage and many parts will be subject to change. Do not depend on it in production.

<!-- 
## Introduction


This library is not meant for simple bots or scripts that 

- 100% type annotations
- Usage of autocompletion is a must: Built using PyCharm and that's where it thrives

in these cases you will be better off using a Telegram client library directly.

### Why Botkit?

- Less repetitive code
- Declarative: Say what you want your application to do, not how to do it


## Features


## Roadmap

- At the moment, only Pyrogram is supported, but Botkit is architected in a way that it will eventually become library-agnostic, meaning that you will be able to use any Python library underneath it. -->
